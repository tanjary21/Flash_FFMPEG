# Flash FFMPEG
## Quick-Access FFMPEG operations directly in Ubuntu Desktop GUI Context Menu 
---
A convenient, user-friendly command set to run ffmpeg commands from the Desktop GUI.

The project started out during my MSc. studies. I found myself having to frequently convert my data/results into visualizations in nice video formats, or ```.gif```s to save on memory. And using ```ffmpeg``` through the terminal just wasn't becoming a reflex fast enough. Frequent errors, incompatible resolution specs, frame rates etc used to slow me down for stuff that really wasn't supposed to take more than 2 seconds. And so, like any decent engineer, I automated my work flows to save on a resource that's very precious in grad school; time.

At the time, these were mostly simple BASH scripts put into my ```.bashrc```. Since then, I've figured out how to put them into Ubuntu's Desktop UI's context menu. I'm now making this available to all as a ```.deb``` package that Linux users can install.
